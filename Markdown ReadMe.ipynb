    "In a weak attempt at finding some silver-lining during these times self-quarantine and stir-crazy infused boredom, I went looking for a good coronavirus dataset with which to practice my newly acquired data science skills. And, by pure chance, The New York Times began offering that data on their [GitHub](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) the very next day and has been updating is regularly since.\n",

    "The goal of the analysis is simple. I want to see what type of government action is most effective in slowing the spread of the coronavirus. To accomplish this, I created graphs for different states, marking the point in time that certain actions were taken, and then marking again 7 days later to delay for the incubation period.\n",
    "\n",
    "While experts have put the [median incubation period at 5.1 days](https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2762808/incubation-period-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-from-publicly-reported), I chose to round it up to 7 days to factor in the potential delay between showing symptoms and being confirmed positive. I could not find any official report on how long the delay between showing symptoms and testing positive is, so the choice of 7 days as a delay is just a choice that I made. If there is a more official way to do this, please comment it in the Issues and I will make the changes needed."

    "While the data used is very likely the best data available at this time, the data is far from perfect. First of all [no test is 100% accurate](https://www.livescience.com/covid19-coronavirus-tests-false-negatives.html). Second of all, [not everyone is being tested](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-testing-us-q-and-a-availability-shortage). These limitations will effect the day to day accuracy, but hopefully not the data as a whole."
